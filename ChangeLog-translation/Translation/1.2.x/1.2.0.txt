You've accomplished a whole bunch of tasks! Got a whole bunch of rewards!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BANANA_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} Dave classmate. Notice that row of banana rocket launchers.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BANANA_2]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} they seem to need our protection!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BANANA_3]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} Go support! After all, bananas are a very charming fruit!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BANANA_4]
{TIRED:WINNIE} Dave classmate, if I had a head, I must be shaking my head now.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}My research shows that bowling is the most fashionable sport in this era.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_2]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} Are you the same as I thought, Penny?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_3]
{TIRED:WINNIE} I can't decipher your thinking process, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} I'm thinking, it should be great to use bowling bubbles here.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_5]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}he. What I'm thinking is how much I like to wear bowling shoes.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} puts colorful colors on my feet!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} When dealing with zombies coming from the deep sea......

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_2]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE}. . . . . . We need a plant with an appetite comparable to a shark.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_3]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} I understand, Penny. You're talking about Chompers!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} Exactly. Its sharp teeth can turn the tide of the battle.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Hey, I have an idea too! We might as well call this Chomper Week!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE} If that had to be the case, classmate Dave. If it must be.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Everything you need for plant growth is complete!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_3]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} has sun, sand and lots of water!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} warning! Dave classmate. My sensor shows that there are zombies on your beach......

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}. . . . . And there is too much water. Will drown plants.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_6]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} What's so hard about this! We just need to put some Lily Pad.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_7]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Then other plants can float on the water!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_8]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE} or, as the saying goes here: they can ride the lotus and break the waves.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_9]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} Right, Penny. Right!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY} Listen carefully, boys! I'm here to pour cold water on you.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
There is a terrible monster deep in {SAY}......

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY} When it swims up, your mind will have to go to it!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{SAY} is waiting to be tortured! Long live Dr. Zombie

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}That guy is hard to deal with.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE} And it's annoying, classmate Dave. Quite annoying.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY} boys, now you are all involved!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_2]
{SAY} The slim eyes of the deep-sea giant zombies have already set their sights on you.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_3]
{SAY} you can run! Can swim too!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_4]
{SAY}But you can't escape from their palms!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_5]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} uh. That guy's hard to deal with.
[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE} And it's annoying, classmate Dave. Quite annoying.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE} Let me tell you, Penny, these zombies who love surfing are really scammers!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} ponder this sentence carefully: pit goods......

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_3]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE}Hmm. Pit. Interestingly. Dave classmate! You're a genius!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} is it?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_5]
{TIRED:WINNIE} No, you are not. But you inspired me.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_6]
{EXCITED:winnie} avocado! This plant can attack zombies with a nuclear that smashes out of a pit.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} and is particularly good at biting people.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_8]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} deploy it on the front line. Wait and see.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE} Phew! It's not easy to resist a tidal army of zombies.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Do you know what we need, Penny? Need a good partner!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} The material I am talking about means attitude. Translate it for you, afraid you won't understand.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} Then I recommend looking for a guide thistle to help.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} I believe it has the kind of material you said.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} its eyes! Piercing! A hard glare will kill those zombies!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_7]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} More importantly, it can shoot deadly darts that can be tracked.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_8]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} can cause a double painful blow just by relying on it! Too ruthless!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_TIDES_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} The tide rises and falls. Who can explain?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_TIDES_5]
{TIRED:WINNIE}This is a scientific question, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}You seaside boy! Stop talking. (MADE BY EVIL)

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}But have you noticed that the big-mouthed flower and the bikini zombies have come too close recently?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY: ZOMBOSSICON} Is a beach romance between plants and zombies brewing?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} Speaking of this, how sure are you of your loyalty to Dazuihua?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} I can’t help but notice. . . . . The plant’s appetite is as big as a zombie.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} chew on those land lovers! Later brethren!
Dr. Zombie

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_7]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} A romance between plants and zombies? Penny. . . . . My head is going to explode!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_8]
{SAY:WINNIE} Dave classmate, don’t rush to draw a conclusion yet. I suggest trying a more productive approach.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_9]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} act quickly!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:WINNIE}Alert! I detected an eerie statue.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} look over there! It was a Tikki idol. With crazy eyes.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} analysis shows that this tiki may launch a terrible challenge to anyone who follows it.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} You mean, they will suffer a tiki ordeal? Understand? Tikimore is difficult?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_5]
{TIRED:WINNIE} Dave classmate, I must admit that your pun is really......
It's hard to grind.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} A romance between plants and zombies? Just crazy!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SHOUT:CRAZYDAVE} In terms of madness, I am an expert!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} I agree. I suspect Dr. Zombie is about to plant the seeds that are disturbing.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} From now on, we can only sow here!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_EXIT:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} nonsense! You have no idea what I have prepared for you!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}The seeds of destruction have been planted! Just wait to be destroyed!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_7]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} But I have to lose my companion now. Come back later for you idiots!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVEICON}Look! It must be time to play beach zombie bango!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}{EXCITED:WINNIEICON} is Bingo, classmate Dave. Oh, Bingo.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_ZOMBIENOTE_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVEICON}You've won, Penny? Whoa-oh. You're awesome!

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} I detected a grid of plants, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} My scanning device shows that their positions can be exchanged for three pairs of elimination games.

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I've seen games like this on my phone!

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} You can upgrade plants with sun.

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} successfully eliminated 100 times to defeat zombies!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY}Hello, plant thief,

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} spies have marked your brains as my property.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} pays tribute to you, Doctor Zombie.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} I don't want my brain to be marked.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} It's hard to clean them up.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}Have you ever considered that you have contracted the madness of Dave?
 (MADE BY EVIL)

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}What zombie riots that pose a threat to your safety.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} You don’t have to use plants to guard your home.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} Those zombies and I are ordinary people and just want to help you.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} I bet you will also say to us the sentence " has nothing in your heart "!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}{START_DIALOG_MUSIC} Dave classmate, it's time to get ready and leave.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_2]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SPECIAL14} has sunk in the west. Let's go!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_3]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}Where do you think we will be taken in the future?

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} What is the future you are talking about?

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} We should look at my time and space corn roll map again.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} My uncle Milo once had that thing, and he called it a bang bang box.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}In fact, it’s far behind. Forget it.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Maybe we can use it to liberate our minds.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} I still have some cleaning work to do.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} It is best to use it to enter a world.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{TIRED:WINNIE} you know, best......

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Corn Roll! I almost forgot!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Exactly! These plants deal with you and your zombies.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} We haven’t even started taking it seriously yet......

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Although those things do exist!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} I admit you are right.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} There are no differences in our views on seriousness.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{START_DIALOG_MUSIC} That looks futuristic.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_10]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Sincerely, Dr. Edgar Zombie Head.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_11]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_12]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVEICON}That Mr. Doctor looks such a good person!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_13]
{TIRED:WINNIEICON}We should be wary of that Dave.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_14]
{SAY:WINNIEICON} at the same time......

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_15]
{EXCITED:WINNIEICON}Getting stars allows you to open the door to time and space you will find later!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_16]
{SAY:WINNIEICON}At the same time, the endless zone is something you can continue to challenge in the future.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_17]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVEICON}{SPECIAL15} Just remember a little. Tomorrow there will always be a corn roll waiting for you......

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_18]
{SPECIAL16:CRAZYDAVE} has a corn roll in all our hearts.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_2]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVEICON} believes that the future Dave will definitely understand the true meaning of the corn roll.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON} I detected high-speed moving super-light particles.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:WINNIEICON} Maybe the future Penny is trying to contact us.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_5]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON} Hello, time travelers.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_6]

[NARRATIVE_DANGER_ROOM_INTRO_BEACH_2]

[NARRATIVE_DANGER_ROOM_INTRO_ICEAGE_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} This place is as cold as, uh, like ice. . . . . . Not to mention there is a large group of zombies waiting for you.

[NARRATIVE_DANGER_ROOM_INTRO_ICEAGE_3]

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:WINNIE}Alert! I detected glass bottles with compound matter and in the disguise of evil!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_2]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE} Can you help me translate this into Crazy Dave's language?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_3]
{TIRED:WINNIE}There is evil potion on the lawn!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} evil medieval potion! It's the most dangerous one......

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} is twice as evil!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Moreover, the sky no longer shines with sun.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_6]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} We need someone to light this place up!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_7]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I see! We need sun mushrooms!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_8]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} These guys don’t just make people’s brows stretch......

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_9]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} will also create more sun! Amazing brothers, it's just genius.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE} I am worried that the Dark Ages have made me suffer from severe vapor disease.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Dave classmate, steam disease is no longer a real disease.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} But I believe that Fume-shroom should be useful.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_4]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} Its steam is quite realistic and it has advantages when dealing with specific zombie enemies.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} is awesome! It's the turn of those zombies to taste the vapor disease!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY} It’s great to see you, a not-so-noble nobleman!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}According to my professional medical opinions, your sense of humor is a bit inaccurate!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}The only treatment is to suck your brain out!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} Get rid of illness and be light, Dr. Zombie

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Hey! I just love that my sense of humor has nothing to do with my brain!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} because I'm crazy!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:WINNIE} Data shows that the Dark Ages were an era of intellectual degradation and moral decay.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_2]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE} Maybe now is the time to let the Hypno-shroom exert its power?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Great idea, Penny! Let's change the evil Dark Age wind!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Ate this mushroom, zombies won’t know what they were bitten by......

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} I'm afraid further research is needed to clarify the true nature of plants food, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_8]

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Why would someone put such a good sword into a dirty stone?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{TIRED:WINNIE} I think this is a test, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} Only those with infinite strength and firm will can pull out their swords.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} I bet someone can solve it with a jackhammer.

{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} ah? But how is that possible? Even the giant zombies will be repelled!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_4]

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE} This is not a good sign.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY}Have you ever thought about how that neighbor named Dave is always so hungry?
 (MADE BY EVIL)

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} What are the secret ingredients in the corn rolls that make him want to stop?

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Will he long for your brain like us?

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}What ?! Impossible. I won't eat corn rolls made with my brain!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE} However, I don’t remember what’s in it either......

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:WINNIE}Although the tetrahedron is a pyramid, this is not a Platonic cube.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I'm so hungry that I want to eat a Platonic cube.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{TIRED:WINNIE} Dave classmate, this is not a corn roll salad.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} It seems that the messenger is sending himself an email!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} This will be very helpful for traveling to other time and space.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} yeah! Time to try the Corn Roll Map!

{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Okay, this will only leave us with more brains. . . . . But not now.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVEICON}{SPECIAL3} Let's go find my tacos!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_4]
{TIRED:WINNIEICON}......
[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} and so on! I remember smelling it when I was chasing squirrels as a kid!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Exactly, classmate Dave. We seem to be in the rock era.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} I suspect that the rhythm of the music may affect the speed of the zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I'm feeling the rhythm, I'm feeling the rhythm!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Someone passed me a small note in the classroom, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} It says that I was asked to meet behind the bicycle shed during my lunch break and said I would give me a big surprise!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} I suspect this note is suspicious, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Have you ever felt weird? You smashed your head? Or " dug " it?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY: ZOMBOSSICON} party is over! Tremble in front of the musical power of my majestic heavy metal giant zombies!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_3]

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} Be brave, classmate Dave. We used rock to level it......

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hmm! Penny, did you smell anything weird?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} No, classmate Dave. Only breakdancing zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Maybe they smell garlic!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Be careful, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} I believe some special zombies will have special abilities when they hear their favorite music.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Are you saying they go even crazier when they go crazy?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} is right, yes, what you said is absolutely right, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Spore mushrooms have a special ability, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} When they destroy a zombie, they will form a new spore mushroom in the place where the zombie falls.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Hey, hey! Spore mushrooms mean more mushrooms!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} So, Penny, do you think you can resurrect dead plants with resurrected radish?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}This. . . . . . This is completely correct, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} sorry. It confuses me when you're concentrating.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I had a real cactus feel for this, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} In fact, Cactus have changed over time, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} Now it causes long-range damage with spines, but also hides and causes ground damage when zombies approach.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} This is such a cactus. . . . . . . Change offensive and defensive postures at any time!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Hmm. You're a dumb guy, I know!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} I heard clearly: You will eventually give up, you will eventually be disappointed, you always love to run around, and I will make you honest.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} I will make you cry, I will say goodbye to you, I am not a good person I warn you!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Ouch!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE} Yaya! It's so dangerous. . . . . . So many exciting beats and rhythm changes!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} I'm worried we just pressed the pause button on Doctor Zombie's conspiracy.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_3]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_EXIT:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}Yeah, the next piece, it'll only be worse! The bad you can't imagine!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Penny! Penny! Penny! A microphone!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} karaoke time is up! My dream of oranges is finally coming true!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Be careful, classmate Dave. Suddenly I picked up this microphone, maybe it will cause another bloody storm! 

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Penny! These plants swap places!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} Exactly, classmate Dave. The positions of the plants can be exchanged for pair elimination of three groups or more.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} You have to eliminate 125 times to defeat the zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} You can use sun to upgrade your plants.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:WINNIE} I discovered three different reinforcement props, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} are power wash plate, power shovel and electric shock finger respectively.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} If you can't find a combination that can be eliminated, you can use powerful version washing to disrupt the layout.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} can replace an eaten plant with a powerful shovel.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} uses electric shock fingers to shock zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_6]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} The last one completely stunned me!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} has to change positions so many times, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} Indeed, it is a protracted battle, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} However, my sensor detected that if we can persevere, we can get generous rewards.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Keep calm and keep changing!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_5_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Phew! That piece of land is just wrinkled like overripe sausages!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_5_OUTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Yes, classmate Dave. But our efforts should be rewarded with generous gold coins.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Alert, classmate Dave! My battery is running out.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} But you need electricity to open the window or put it down!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}correct. Maybe with some charged plants can help me get my electricity back.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} This sounds reasonable, maybe!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:WINNIE} My battery is almost fully charged, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_INTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Wow! So many electrons!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}The current red currant sparks are splashing and shining!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Indeed, its electrical energy brings infinite vitality.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} will add another outstanding new member to our collection.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_HURRIKALE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}My data shows that hurricane cabbage will be of great use.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_HURRIKALE_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} The wind he blows can freeze zombies and slow them down!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_HURRIKALE_3]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} This guy is particularly good at blowing! I mean, the kind that blows wonderfully.
[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_ICEBLOCKS_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} I'm already interested in this idea!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} is too quiet. Where'd everyone go? I have a hunch of not wanting.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}My scanner shows zombies hiding under the ice.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} I know this game! They call it hide-and-seek, eat the brain!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} It’s time to play our own game: I asked it to freeze.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} beat them hard and they will fall out with a better hammer.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_6]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} I'm sorry. I can't control it. Had to say. Now it's. . . . . Hammer time.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}This place makes me feel cold hands and feet.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} My feet are really cold.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_3]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE}It's time to turn on the heating. I recommend the pepper pitcher for this task.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} He can throw hot peppers at zombies to warm up the zombies around him.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} Let's pick a pepper pitcher! This is the perfect plant for our current dilemma!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE} Do you have to rhyme when speaking, classmate Dave? Must?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE} I hope these prehistoric zombies can obediently return to their caves.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_2]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} Dave classmate, maybe it’s time to try new strategies.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} data shows that Vertigo Onion will be a.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Good idea, Penny! That guy's breath can smudge people!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_5]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} is no exaggeration. Even zombies. . . . . . would be smudged by the smell of his mouth!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_6]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} is disgusting. But really reliable!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Penny, we need a nice cup of hot cocoa right now!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Dave classmate, that is an anti-zombie weapon without verification.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} I recommend summoning spinning turnips.

{EXCITED:WINNIE} She can float in the air and shoot zombies in four directions!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} This child is very talented! Perhaps she also knows how to make hot cocoa?
[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:winnie} Dave classmate, I detected an ice cube approaching.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} looks like a popsicle zombie. 

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} analysis shows that this terrifying ice cube will unlock a shivering challenge.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} Do you know what I will say? Put---come here!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVEICON}Penny, have you ever licked a popsicle hairpin to your tongue?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}{TIRED:WINNIEICON}No, classmate Dave. I haven't tried.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVEICON} uh. . . . . . I don't have either. Doing that must be four crazy!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_4]
{SAY:WINNIEICON}Hey. Keep an eye out for strange slabs during your tongue recovery. 

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_5]
{SAY:WINNIEICON} It seems to be a warning sign, written in cave zombie language.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_6]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVEICON} Does it shrink and don’t lick popsicles?

[NARRATIVE_JACKOLANTERN_LOD_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Click on the Jack pumpkin lamp to release the flame.

[NARRATIVE_JACKOLANTERN_LOD_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} click and hold to extend release time and increase damage!

[NARRATIVE_LAWN_MOWERS_FILL_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{EXCITED:WINNIE} Wow, lawnmowers can keep chasing zombies!

[NARRATIVE_LAWN_MOWERS_FILL_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Pay attention to the lawnmower where zombies fall, but at the same time......

[NARRATIVE_LAWN_MOWERS_FILL_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Let me restore your lawnmower to combat form.

[NARRATIVE_LAWN_MOWERS_FILL_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} Don’t worry, this time it’s free, and it should be placed close to the house.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_BIG_REWARD_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE} you are so nice! As expected, it is well-deserved. . . . . . Mr. Caitan!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_BIG_REWARD_INTRO_2]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Have you seen my tacos, Mr. Can? It's probably that big......

[NARRATIVE_LOD_BIG_REWARD_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED} is that. Please destroy this vision before Dave is possessed.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_LEVEL_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED} Dave classmate, it doesn't look like a party.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_LEVEL_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{PLAYFUL} But it may also be a surprise party, with gifts and everything!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_LEVEL_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} You will know, Penny, I think these zombies are different.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}{EXCITED} In the modern era, your house is about to be attacked!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{EXCITED} I bet that's not an attack. . . . . I bet that's a party! Oh, I hope it's a can party!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIEICON} That's not a party, it's zombies from different time and space ready to invade!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:WINNIEICON}Who knows if they will still bring gifts?

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVEICON} I think it's a party! Better hurry, I don't want to miss it!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON} party is over, but the zombies will be back soon.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{PLAYFUL}As for them. . . . . More color jars!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIEICON} Defending multiple party attacks in a row can trigger a large color can vision.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVEICON} I can’t wait to attend the next color pot party, and there are subsequent events!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_5]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVEICON}But those colored jars reminded me of my lost sad tacos. Let's go!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_RESET_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON} Miss the accumulation of large color can portraits reset at the color can party.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_RESET_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIEICON} I won't pretend to understand why, but the data won't lie.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_RESET_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{EXCITED} If you detect the color pot party, just tell us.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_RESET_INTRO_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVEICON} For parties, these parties are hard to find.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_REWARD_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE} What am I telling you, Penny? A surprise pot party!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_REWARD_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED} illogical. It seems that a level 3 diagnostic examination is necessary.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_REWARD_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} color can! Let's open some and see what we'll get!

[NARRATIVE_MINIGAME_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{SAY} Let's break with tradition now.

{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}{TIRED}That's called the can breaker, classmate Dave. Canbreaker.

{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Corn Roll--------!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_11_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} We picked up some seed bags of Shadow Mushrooms, classmate Dave. 

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_11_INTRO_2]

{SAY:WINNIE} If you click on it and click on another plant, they will swap positions!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}You can use the escape roots to save creatures in danger!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}My scan shows it releases special light to strengthen its species.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} Planting moonlight flowers together should improve their power.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} I guess they will have the same effect on other shadow plants. 

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Corn Roll-----!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_25_OUTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} I'm worried, classmate Dave. What if what he says is true?

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_25_OUTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I don't care about anything but corn rolls, Penny! Forward!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_26_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Please, time zipper, you must follow the truth!

{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}The coherence of time has been shattered! Our times have become meaningless!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_26_INTRO_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Everything becomes paradoxical!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_26_INTRO_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Let the squirrels out!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Welcome to join the new time and space journey! It is the 13th century, Europe full of literary and artistic atmosphere.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} detector shows us in the museum.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} See if the collars of those guys look like corn rolls, maybe they also like to eat corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} I don’t know if they like corn rolls, but they definitely still like brains the most.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look! What are those round things? Uh! New taco, I guess?

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} That is the Vitruvian ring. If you use the ring rationally, it will become a secret weapon against zombies!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:WINNIE} winter melon guards can help us use secret weapons.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_9]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}What are those arrows on the ground? As if to say there's a corn roll in front!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_10]
{SAY:WINNIE}The arrow on the ground determines the rolling direction of the ring.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} ah ah ah ah oh my God! The fog here almost made me unable to open my eyes!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Our detector shows that these fogs are poisonous, be careful!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Look at that guy holding a bottle in his hand. Could it be a corn roll-flavored drink!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's a perfumer zombie, and the bottle in his hand can create poisonous mist that can cause damage to plants.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh! This damn poisonous fog, I'm almost suffocating!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} We need a plant that can purify poisonous mist!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE}Aloe vera doctors can purify poisonous mist made by perfumers and increase the attack power of plants.
 

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I saw a lot of incredible statues, it was so interesting! Lol!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh! Take a look at those stone statues!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} This is really interesting hahaha! I bet they're definitely because of stealing the corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} Those are zombie statues, they will become real zombies at night, we have to break them up during the day!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Beware of nightfall.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hey! What's a guy there that looks like he's carving?

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's the Sculptor Zombie, which can carve rough stones into zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} looks very interesting, I think I also have the talent to become a sculptor!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} data shows that your figure has reduced the success rate by 99.9999.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Destroying the rough stone in advance can prevent sculptor zombies from carving out zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Those guys, the clothes they wear are so strange, they don’t walk well! I bet they must be drunk!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's the ballet zombies, they always appear in groups of four.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} What a terrible setting, will four people need to share the same corn roll? If so, I would rather appear alone......

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} uses olives to stop fast-moving ballet zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Take a look at those stone statues!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Those are zombie statues, they will become real zombies at night, we have to use tools to solve them during the day!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} This is really interesting hahaha! I bet they must've eaten the corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}The number of attention tools is limited.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! Here's what looks like a lot of mustard-flavored corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Welcome to join the new time and space journey! It is 10th century, Heian period Japan.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} detector shows us at a shrine near Mount Fuji.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Look at the hairstyles of those guys that look like corn rolls. I’m not sure they really have corn rolls hidden in their hair!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} According to scan analysis, there are no corn rolls hidden in their hair, and they all wear wigs.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look! What's that box there? Uh! A lunch box with tornadoes, I guess?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} That is the money box. Reasonable use of different money boxes will help you deal with zombies better!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:WINNIE} Of course, you have to put coins into it first. Oh, I mean your plants food

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_9]
{SAY:WINNIE} sun Competition Cash Box can return part of the sun planted in nearby plants.
 

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_1]

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} warns, that's a fireworks zombie, and the sprayed fireworks will light us up!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Wow! This hot feeling, did they add chili sauce to it?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} The water droplets of ice lotus can extinguish the fireworks flames ejected by the fireworks tube.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Then what are you waiting for, quick!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh! It's an unusual money box for a race, will it have a corn roll in it this time?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_3_INTRO_2]

{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}wow, it seems like an unbearable zombie has emerged.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE2_1]
Be careful about {NPC_ENTER:winnie} that's not good.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE3_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave} let me use my favorite pea shooter to attack

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE4_1]
What happened to {NPC_ENTER:crazydave} totally unmoved, what can we do?

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}beeps.... The test report is out.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_2]
The report says this is Dr. Zombie's latest masterpiece! You need to find a way to beat the toughness value to beat it!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_3]
Now zombies are in a high injury free state, only breaking toughness can cause normal damage to zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_4]
{ SAY:winnie } Yellow strips are the toughness value of zombies, do you see the sign next to the toughness value?

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE6_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave} I should look at it carefully.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE7_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} Using electric energy attributes to reduce toughness each time, you summoned 5 electric peas to try it!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE8_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} Zombies are in a weak state, and now grab the output! Don't let the zombies come back!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE9_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave} call! It's not easy!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE10_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} That's it! Plants using corresponding properties when encountering toughness zombies can break toughness values faster!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE10_2]
{SAY:winnie} According to the reports, there are even higher-level attribute attacks that can inflict more damage on resilience values. I'll leave this exploration to you!

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS1_1]
Be sure Penny looks, how can there be so many magic caps, which one is better for me?

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS2_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} beeps ... we seem to be at the scene of the event of "Guess Who I am", and each magic cap seems to have something different under it.

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS2_2]
