{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} What's so hard about this! We just need to put some Lily Pad.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_7]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Then other plants can float on the water!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_8]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE} or, as the saying goes here: they can ride the lotus and break the waves.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_9]

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE} Let me tell you, Penny, these zombies who love surfing are really scammers!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} ponder this sentence carefully: pit goods......

{SAY:WINNIE} I believe it has the kind of material you said.

{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} its eyes! Piercing! A hard glare will kill those zombies!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_7]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} More importantly, it can shoot deadly darts that can be tracked.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_8]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} can cause a double painful blow just by relying on it! Too ruthless!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_TIDES_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} The tide rises and falls. Who can explain?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_TIDES_5]
{TIRED:WINNIE}This is a scientific question, classmate Dave.

{SAY:WINNIE} analysis shows that this tiki may launch a terrible challenge to anyone who follows it.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} You mean, they will suffer a tiki ordeal? Understand? Tikimore is difficult?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_5]
{TIRED:WINNIE} Dave classmate, I must admit that your pun is really......
It's hard to grind.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} A romance between plants and zombies? Just crazy!

{SHOUT:CRAZYDAVE} In terms of madness, I am an expert!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} I agree. I suspect Dr. Zombie is about to plant the seeds that are disturbing.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} From now on, we can only sow here!

{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} I detected a grid of plants, classmate Dave.

{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} I bet you will also say to us the sentence " has nothing in your heart "!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}{START_DIALOG_MUSIC} Dave classmate, it's time to get ready and leave.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}In fact, it's far behind. Forget it.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Maybe we can use it to liberate our minds.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} I still have some cleaning work to do.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]

{SAY:WINNIE} Dave classmate, steam disease is no longer a real disease.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} But I believe that Fume-shroom should be useful.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_4]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} Its steam is quite realistic and it has advantages when dealing with specific zombie enemies.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} is awesome! It's the turn of those zombies to taste the vapor disease!

{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} because I'm crazy!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:WINNIE} Data shows that the Dark Ages were an era of intellectual degradation and moral decay.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_2]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE} Maybe now is the time to let the Hypno-shroom exert its power?

{EXCITED:WINNIE} Dave classmate! Maybe your brain isn't as abnormal as you insist!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_4]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE} Is there a plant that can have the functions of both pea shooter and nut?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} We will call it. . . . . . Peanut Sagittarius!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_6]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} combines the combat effectiveness of two plants into one?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Incredible! We will only feed the highest quality organic matter to plants......

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE} Hey, Penny, what are plants food made of?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} I'm afraid further research is needed to clarify the true nature of plants food, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_8]
{TIRED:WINNIE} I still have to do some tests, forgive me for missing me.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Why would someone put such a good sword into a dirty stone?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{TIRED:WINNIE} I think this is a test, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} Only those with infinite strength and firm will can pull out their swords.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} I bet someone can solve it with a jackhammer.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} as long as that person is crazy enough!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE} This method is too vulgar, but it obviously works, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} I did not find zombies or zombie-related ingredients in the plants food.

{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} alert! Dave classmate. My sensor shows that we have entered the past 153,954,765 years.

{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Wow! I wasn't born at that time!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}correct. We seem to have entered a Jurassic swamp.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} No wonder I smell more oxygen!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_15_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look, Penny! A dancing star!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_15_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}That's a meteor. Interesting. The record shows that this should be.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_15_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} bigger? Like, the size of an oversized corn roll?

[NARRATIVE_DINO_15_OUTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} is as big as Seattle. I hope history will not go wrong......

[NARRATIVE_DINO_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} Put your brain aside first, it's time to be crazy!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} Or just wait for the same fate as these terrible thunder and lightning lizards: extinction!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_17_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}What's wrong with you, classmate Dave?

[NARRATIVE_DINO_17_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I have always wanted a primitive sunflower that releases a lot of sun!

{SAY:WINNIE} Your wish will come true soon, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_2_INTRO_1]

{SAY:WINNIE} I mean sauropods, classmate Dave. Dinosaurs.

{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Beware of Jurassic savage zombies, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} They are immune to the repulsive effect of primitive pea shooters.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} ah? But how is that possible? Even the giant zombies will be repelled!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} is real, classmate Dave. Savage zombies are so stupid that they don't even follow the classic physical rules.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_23_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} I found the original potato mine nearby, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_23_INTRO_2]

{SAY:WINNIE}My sensors show that they can wrap zombies with their tails and throw them out.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_9_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} Coincidentally, a group of pterodactyls are approaching, classmate Dave.

{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} Can you not use your stupid method to cause trouble for me?

[NARRATIVE_DINO_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} Stay well and don't move. I have a huge stone block that I intend to introduce to you.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} I hate little stones!

{SAY:WINNIE} The claw prints of this velociraptor show that we have entered the ancient dinosaur arena, classmate Dave!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} I detected a shooting star passing by, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} I recommend evacuating this space-time immediately.

{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Goodbye, dinosaurs! You guys will be birds right away!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_EXIT:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON} Bah! Now I have no choice but to implement. . . . . Paradox mode!

{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} Please fill in the mailing form before they arrive.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} Greetings, Doctor Zombie.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Cool, that Doctor Zomboss wants your autograph!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE} This is not a good sign.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY}Have you ever thought about how that neighbor named Dave is always so hungry?
 (MADE BY EVIL)

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} What are the secret ingredients in the corn rolls that make him want to stop?

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Will he long for your brain like us?

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}What ?! Impossible. I won't eat corn rolls made with my brain!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE} However, I don't remember what's in it either......

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:WINNIE}Although the tetrahedron is a pyramid, this is not a Platonic cube.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I'm so hungry that I want to eat a Platonic cube.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{TIRED:WINNIE} Dave classmate, this is not a corn roll salad.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} It seems that the messenger is sending himself an email!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} This will be very helpful for traveling to other time and space.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} yeah! Time to try the Corn Roll Map!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{PLAYFUL}wait!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE} never had meat in that corn roll.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} still has scraps in my beard to testify!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Okay, this will only leave us with more brains. . . . . But not now.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} No matter when and where, I will definitely find you again!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVEICON}{SPECIAL3} Let's go find my tacos!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_6]
{TIRED:WINNIEICON}......

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{EXCITED}Good news! Penny found a map to my tornadoes!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}{TIRED}No, that is a map of time and space, marked with plants that can help us.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVEICON}{SPECIAL3} Let's go find my tacos!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_4]
{TIRED:WINNIEICON}......
[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} and so on! I remember smelling it when I was chasing squirrels as a kid!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Exactly, classmate Dave. We seem to be in the rock era.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} I suspect that the rhythm of the music may affect the speed of the zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I'm feeling the rhythm, I'm feeling the rhythm!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Someone passed me a small note in the classroom, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} It says that I was asked to meet behind the bicycle shed during my lunch break and said I would give me a big surprise!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} I suspect this note is suspicious, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Have you ever felt weird? You smashed your head? Or " dug " it?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY: ZOMBOSSICON} party is over! Tremble in front of the musical power of my majestic heavy metal giant zombies!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I'm so scared, Penny! Two minutes to midnight!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} Be brave, classmate Dave. We used rock to level it......

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hmm! Penny, did you smell anything weird?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} No, classmate Dave. Only breakdancing zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Maybe they smell garlic!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Be careful, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} I believe some special zombies will have special abilities when they hear their favorite music.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Are you saying they go even crazier when they go crazy?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} is right, yes, what you said is absolutely right, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Spore mushrooms have a special ability, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} When they destroy a zombie, they will form a new spore mushroom in the place where the zombie falls.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Hey, hey! Spore mushrooms mean more mushrooms!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} So, Penny, do you think you can resurrect dead plants with resurrected radish?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}This. . . . . . This is completely correct, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} sorry. It confuses me when you're concentrating.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I had a real cactus feel for this, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} In fact, Cactus have changed over time, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} Now it causes long-range damage with spines, but also hides and causes ground damage when zombies approach.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} This is such a cactus. . . . . . . Change offensive and defensive postures at any time!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Hmm. You're a dumb guy, I know!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} I heard clearly: You will eventually give up, you will eventually be disappointed, you always love to run around, and I will make you honest.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} I will make you cry, I will say goodbye to you, I am not a good person I warn you!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Ouch!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE} Yaya! It's so dangerous. . . . . . So many exciting beats and rhythm changes!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} I'm worried we just pressed the pause button on Doctor Zombie's conspiracy.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_3]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_EXIT:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}Yeah, the next piece, it'll only be worse! The bad you can't imagine!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Penny! Penny! Penny! A microphone!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} karaoke time is up! My dream of oranges is finally coming true!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Be careful, classmate Dave. Suddenly I picked up this microphone, maybe it will cause another bloody storm! 

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Penny! These plants swap places!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} Exactly, classmate Dave. The positions of the plants can be exchanged for pair elimination of three groups or more.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} You have to eliminate 125 times to defeat the zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} You can use sun to upgrade your plants.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:WINNIE} I discovered three different reinforcement props, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} are power wash plate, power shovel and electric shock finger respectively.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} If you can't find a combination that can be eliminated, you can use powerful version washing to disrupt the layout.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} can replace an eaten plant with a powerful shovel.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} uses electric shock fingers to shock zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_6]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} The last one completely stunned me!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} has to change positions so many times, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} Indeed, it is a protracted battle, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} However, my sensor detected that if we can persevere, we can get generous rewards.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Keep calm and keep changing!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_5_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Phew! That piece of land is just wrinkled like overripe sausages!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_5_OUTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Yes, classmate Dave. But our efforts should be rewarded with generous gold coins.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Alert, classmate Dave! My battery is running out.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} But you need electricity to open the window or put it down!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}correct. Maybe with some charged plants can help me get my electricity back.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} This sounds reasonable, maybe!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:WINNIE} My battery is almost fully charged, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_INTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Wow! So many electrons!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}The current red currant sparks are splashing and shining!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Indeed, its electrical energy brings infinite vitality.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} will add another outstanding new member to our collection.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} I detected a current red currant plant, Dave classmate.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} If you plant two trees in the same row or column, you can form an electric field between them.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} electric field can cause damage to zombies and charge my battery.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} What an amazing invention!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} I detected the mine car, classmate Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_4_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} uses them to shock zombies with the electric field of current red currants.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} What a good idea!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} This electricity shocked my beard! Can we just take a break on the beach?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Of course, classmate Dave. Get ready for the beach party's offensive.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Can we have some bananas?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} supplies bananas.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} How about your battery, Penny?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} charges well, classmate Dave, thank you for your concern.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} current red currant really helped.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} is really power infinite!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_9_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE} Pay attention to the rolling boulders.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_9_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} After triggering, they will destroy the plants and zombies together.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Attention, classmate Dave! I detected sonic signals and there was a place where there was a whole bunch of zombie gems hidden. 

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} has been discovered by you for hiding so well, ha?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} If we move fast enough, maybe we can snatch them over.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} gem, come with me!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Those gems are so close at hand that I can smell them!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_INTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} is like a gooseberry in spring!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} hiss! Rascals! Gem-stealing villain!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON} doesn't matter! My plan goes fast!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}The zombies learned about our gem project, classmate Dave.

{PLAYFUL:WINNIE}According to my data, the skulls of these cave zombies are 33.2% harder than those of other zombies.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_4]

{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}My data shows that hurricane cabbage will be of great use.

{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} This guy is particularly good at blowing! I mean, the kind that blows wonderfully.
[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_ICEBLOCKS_4]

{SAY:WINNIE}My scanner shows zombies hiding under the ice.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} I know this game! They call it hide-and-seek, eat the brain!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} It's time to play our own game: I asked it to freeze.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} beat them hard and they will fall out with a better hammer.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_6]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} I'm sorry. I can't control it. Had to say. Now it's. . . . . Hammer time.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} Let's pick a pepper pitcher! This is the perfect plant for our current dilemma!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE} Do you have to rhyme when speaking, classmate Dave? Must?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE} I hope these prehistoric zombies can obediently return to their caves.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_2]
{EXCITED:WINNIE} Dave classmate, maybe it's time to try new strategies.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_3]

{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Good idea, Penny! That guy's breath can smudge people!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_5]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} is no exaggeration. Even zombies. . . . . . would be smudged by the smell of his mouth!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_6]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE} is disgusting. But really reliable!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Penny, we need a nice cup of hot cocoa right now!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! It looks like a place with lots of taco!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Welcome to join the new time and space journey! It is the 13th century, Europe full of literary and artistic atmosphere.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} detector shows us in the museum.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} See if the collars of those guys look like corn rolls, maybe they also like to eat corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} I don't know if they like corn rolls, but they definitely still like brains the most.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look! What are those round things? Uh! New taco, I guess?

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} That is the Vitruvian ring. If you use the ring rationally, it will become a secret weapon against zombies!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:WINNIE} winter melon guards can help us use secret weapons.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_9]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}What are those arrows on the ground? As if to say there's a corn roll in front!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_10]
{SAY:WINNIE}The arrow on the ground determines the rolling direction of the ring.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} ah ah ah ah oh my God! The fog here almost made me unable to open my eyes!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Our detector shows that these fogs are poisonous, be careful!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Look at that guy holding a bottle in his hand. Could it be a corn roll-flavored drink!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's a perfumer zombie, and the bottle in his hand can create poisonous mist that can cause damage to plants.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh! This damn poisonous fog, I'm almost suffocating!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} We need a plant that can purify poisonous mist!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE}Aloe vera doctors can purify poisonous mist made by perfumers and increase the attack power of plants.
 

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I saw a lot of incredible statues, it was so interesting! Lol!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh! Take a look at those stone statues!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} This is really interesting hahaha! I bet they're definitely because of stealing the corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} Those are zombie statues, they will become real zombies at night, we have to break them up during the day!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Beware of nightfall.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hey! What's a guy there that looks like he's carving?

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's the Sculptor Zombie, which can carve rough stones into zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} looks very interesting, I think I also have the talent to become a sculptor!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} data shows that your figure has reduced the success rate by 99.9999.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Destroying the rough stone in advance can prevent sculptor zombies from carving out zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Those guys, the clothes they wear are so strange, they don't walk well! I bet they must be drunk!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's the ballet zombies, they always appear in groups of four.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} What a terrible setting, will four people need to share the same corn roll? If so, I would rather appear alone......

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} uses olives to stop fast-moving ballet zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Take a look at those stone statues!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Those are zombie statues, they will become real zombies at night, we have to use tools to solve them during the day!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} This is really interesting hahaha! I bet they must've eaten the corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}The number of attention tools is limited.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! Here's what looks like a lot of mustard-flavored corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Welcome to join the new time and space journey! It is 10th century, Heian period Japan.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} detector shows us at a shrine near Mount Fuji.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Look at the hairstyles of those guys that look like corn rolls. I'm not sure they really have corn rolls hidden in their hair!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} According to scan analysis, there are no corn rolls hidden in their hair, and they all wear wigs.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look! What's that box there? Uh! A lunch box with tornadoes, I guess?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} That is the money box. Reasonable use of different money boxes will help you deal with zombies better!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:WINNIE} Of course, you have to put coins into it first. Oh, I mean your plants food

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_9]
{SAY:WINNIE} sun Competition Cash Box can return part of the sun planted in nearby plants.
 

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh my God! They have a chimney in their hand, and they're gonna fire!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} warns, that's a fireworks zombie, and the sprayed fireworks will light us up!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Wow! This hot feeling, did they add chili sauce to it?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} The water droplets of ice lotus can extinguish the fireworks flames ejected by the fireworks tube.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Then what are you waiting for, quick!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh! It's an unusual money box for a race, will it have a corn roll in it this time?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Pay attention to the pattern on the money box. This is the energy money box, which allows nearby plants to release their ultimate moves together.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Is there any other case? I wish I had a case that would hold a taco!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_4_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Dear Dave, forget about the corn rolls for now. This is the plant race cash box,

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} can provide you with a high-level plant to help you solve powerful zombies.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Those guys have a lot in their hands! Is this coming to give a gift?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Please be careful, they are ninja kid zombies, holding pufferfish in their hands, alive!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} What do these guys want to do? I bet they must be because I want to steal my tacos!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} The probability of this possibility is 0.01%. At the same time, the information showed that they were experts in the sneak attack.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} But we have Qianjin Teng, who is an expert in dealing with this kind of ninja.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Uh, again a different box. No taco in it anyway.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Yes, this is a jumping money box that can elevate nearby plants and zombies to the first level, please use it carefully.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hey! What do you smell? Corn rolls are ten thousand times more fragrant than this thing!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Dave, I don't have a nose, and secondly it's the sushi chef zombie, who makes quite delicious sushi,

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} makes it more difficult for other zombies to eat.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} However, Pyo Ran is a super chef and is eager to have a gourmet showdown with these sushi chefs.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Maybe it's time for us to give way.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Should I ask him to make me a corn roll?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! What a wind! It feels like it's going to blow my pot helmet off!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} data shows that strong winds often hit this place, and it may be accompanied by terrible cyclones,

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} This has a huge impact on us.

When the zombie has resilience value, it provides a damage absorption effect.

[ZOMBIE_ICEAGE_CHIEF_ELITE_DESCRIPTION]
After a routine attack one day, the Icewind Chieftain Zombie discovered the guy in the cave across from him wearing a pan on his head and holding a fan-like device. Then the Icewind Chieftain Zombie was blown away. After being blown away so many times, now the Icewind Chieftain Zombie has learned how to fight against that fan device.

{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}wow, it seems like an unbearable zombie has emerged.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE2_1]
Be careful about {NPC_ENTER:winnie} that's not good.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE3_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave} let me use my favorite pea shooter to attack

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE4_1]
What happened to {NPC_ENTER:crazydave} totally unmoved, what can we do?

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}beeps.... The test report is out.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_2]
The report says this is Dr. Zombie's latest masterpiece! You need to find a way to beat the toughness value to beat it!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_3]
Now zombies are in a high injury free state, only breaking toughness can cause normal damage to zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_4]
{ SAY:winnie } Yellow strips are the toughness value of zombies, do you see the sign next to the toughness value?

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE6_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave} I should look at it carefully.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE7_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} Using electric energy attributes to reduce toughness each time, you summoned 5 electric peas to try it!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE8_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} Zombies are in a weak state, and now grab the output! Don't let the zombies come back!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE9_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave} call! It's not easy!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE10_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} That's it! Plants using corresponding properties when encountering toughness zombies can break toughness values faster!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE10_2]
{SAY:winnie} According to the reports, there are even higher-level attribute attacks that can inflict more damage on resilience values. I'll leave this exploration to you!

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS1_1]
Be sure Penny looks, how can there be so many magic caps, which one is better for me?

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS2_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} beeps ... we seem to be at the scene of the event of "Guess Who I am", and each magic cap seems to have something different under it.

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS2_2]
{SAY:winnie} Oh? I'm a little curious, let me see.

[ZOMBIE_DARK_KING_ELITE_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
The Elite Dark King Zombie has a resilience bar mechanism; physical attacks can reduce its resilience (stunning effects can cause high reductions). Emptying the resilience bar puts the zombie into a weakened state, during which the zombie will not act or attack until the resilience bar is fully restored. While the zombie has resilience, it provides damage absorption limits.
